# Git and GitHub Demo

**GitHub:** A Microsoft Company which provides a platform for developers to host their code and collaborate with others.

- A `cloud code-sharing platform`.
- Multiple developers can work on the same project or codebase from anywhere in the world.

**git:** A version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase and collaborate with others.

**Version Control:** A system that `records changes` to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

**For example:** `Google docs`, where you can see the history of changes made to a document and revert to a previous version if needed.

## Why readme.md?

- A readme file is a text file that provides information about a `project` or `codebase`.
- It is usually the first file that developers see when they visit a repository.
- It helps developers understand what the project is about, how to set it up, and how to contribute to it.
- markdown: A lightweight markup language that is used to format text on the web.

## Process Flow

1. Create a new project folder on your local machine.
2. Create a readme.md file in the project folder and add some details about the project.
3. Initialize a git repository in the project folder using the `git init` command.

### Scenario 2

- You are working on a project with multiple developers.

### Features List:

- [x] Create a new repository on GitHub.
- [x] Add a remote repository to your local git repository.
- [x] Push your code to the remote repository.
- [x] Collaborate with other developers on the project.
